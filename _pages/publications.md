<li> <b>Cobalt single atom anchored on N-doped carbon nanoboxes as typical single-atom catalysts (SACs) for boosting the overall water splitting</b>,  <em>Chemical Engineering Journal</em>, 458 (2023) 141435 <a href="/files/5.pdf">pdf</a>

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are considered one of the promising strategies to achieve efficient energy conversion, due to their advantage of both maximum atomic utilization and minimum catalyst cost. However, finding a balance between increasing the atom loading and preventing the agglomeration of metal single atoms is a current research hotspot.
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
Herein, we have developed single-atom cobalt embedded in N-doped carbon nanoboxes as high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline/acidic electrolytes. Due to the reliable metal-nonmetal bonds between the Co single atom and the substrate carbon, where the uniformly dispersed Co atoms could be effectively and stably riveted on the carbon nanoboxes, and the as-prepared electrocatalyst possesses high mass loading of single Co atoms (~10.2 wt%). In addition, the systematic X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to further investigate the relationship between coordination number, configuration and electrocatalytic properties of Co single atoms and N atoms. Based on the above results, the presence of Co atoms induces the formation of pyrr-N and possesses Co@CNB-N<sub>4</sub> configuration with HER overpotential of 45 mV, comparable to Pt/C (20 wt%). As for OER, Co@CNB-N<sub>4</sub> still has satisfactory catalytic performance, superior to the benchmark catalyst RuO<sub>2</sub>. 
<p style="margin-top: -2.5%;">
Thus, this work builds a bridge to understand the impact of metal single atoms and substrate configuration on catalytic performance and opens a door to the successful synthesis of SACs with high loading of non-precious metal atoms, high atomic utilization and electrocatalytic activity.

The Yb<sup>3+</sup>-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/BiOIO<sub>3</sub> triple heterojunction photocatalyst was successfully prepared by the EG assisted hydrothermal method and the calcination method. Bi2O3 has a variety of crystal phase structures. Through characterizations and DFT theoretical calculations, it is shown that different proportion of Yb3+ doping makes the lattice phase transition of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. 
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
When the mole ratio of Yb<sup>3+</sup> doping in the complex is 1%, the coexistence and recombination of α-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, β-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> lead to the formation of triple heterojunction and the establishment of a unique electronic transmission channel, which promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. At the same time, Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions have unique electronic transition characteristics, which effectively broaden the spectral response range of the Yb<sup>3+</sup>-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/BiOIO<sub>3</sub> photocatalyst, and also improve the photocatalytic activity. 
<p style="margin-top: -2.5%;">
Thanks to its optimized performance, the best efficiency of the Yb<sup>3+</sup>-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/BiOIO<sub>3</sub> triple heterojunction photocatalyst in removing gaseous Hg0 under visible light can reach 76.73%, which is much higher than that of its pure component. Finally, the mechanism of high efficiency catalytic oxidation was proposed by combining rare earth ion doping with semiconductor recombination to construct heterojunction catalysts with a wide spectral response. This work provides a new method for designing efficient photocatalysts.

Impressive developments have been achieved in the field of bifunctional electrocatalysts for the overall water splitting in alkaline and weak alkaline electrolytes, but still challenging. Herein, we have coupled the early and later transition metals to form novel bimetallic tellurides electrocatalyst for overall water splitting by simple one-step hydrothermal. 
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
Owing to the large specific surface area of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as substrates, the as-prepared NiTe-HfTe<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> displays appealing electrocatalytic activity and satisfactory stability in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, the electrolytic cell with two electrodes assembled by NiTe-HfTe<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> demonstrates the same excellent performance in overall water splitting. The strong electronegativity of Te and the synergistic effect between Ni and Hf together contribute to the overall water splitting process.

The exploration of high-efficiency and reliable non-precious metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is greatly vital and challenging for scientists to explore the physical structure effects with OER catalysts. Herein, we firstly developed three-dimensional ɑlpha-Nickel hydroxide as an advantageous electrocatalyst towards OER by a simple solvothermal method. 
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
By controlling the solvent, two kinds of regular and one kind of irregular pure ɑlpha-Nickel hydroxide were successfully synthesized. Two regular catalysts’ catalytic activity can be enhanced by the level of regularity increasing. Interestingly, as the increase of irregularity, compared with nanosphere-like Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, nanoparticle-sphere-like Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> sample’s specific surface areas, number of ion transport channels, and reaction kinetics performance also raise, which actually enhance catalytic activity. In a word, the most irregular Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-NPS has the best electrocatalytic activity (η = 250 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (73.9 mV dec-1), and the outstanding constancy (8 h) at 1.48 V (vs. RHE) could be achieved, meanwhile, the benchmark RuO<sub>2</sub> (340 mV and 87.4 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>) is also inferior to Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-NPS. </p>

By comparing three Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> samples, this work provides the new single transition metal system about 3D materials and facilitate the development of highly efficient water oxidation catalysts. </p>

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a part reaction of the overall water splitting, is deemed as a prospective technology for large-scale energy storage. However, the sluggish kinetics (large overpotential) and the expensive cost of noble metal-based electrocatalysts (RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub>) restrain the widespread usage of OER. Hence, the discovery of non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts with tiny overpotential, satisfactory current density and outstanding stability has become urgent. 
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
In this work, we have prepared ultra-thin layered g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> by a two-step thermal peeling method and synthesized Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> com<sup></sup>posite by a simple one-step solvothermal method. Benefiting from the layered g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as substrate, the overpotential of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite was just 240 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, which gives an unexpected improvement in the electrochemical performance of the composite samples compared to pure Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (η = 460 mV). Additionally, the formation of heterojunction effectively reduces the resistance to electron transport in OER, the resistance of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (Rct = 38.8 ) is far smaller than those of bare Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (Rct = 41.6 ) and layered g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (Rct = 43.6 ) at the open circuit potential. Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite samples display outstanding electrochemical stability, maintaining 85% of initial current density for 12 h. 
<p style="margin-top: -2.5%;">
Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that G3 of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite (η = 0.46 V) is much lower than that of bare Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (η = 0.64 V). These undeniable results demonstrate that Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite materials is promising alternative materials to replace precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts in the field of water splitting
